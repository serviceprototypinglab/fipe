Fully Individualised Programmable Exams - FIPEs

Note: This is an early-stage prototype. It needs to be invoked directly
from the repository instead of being installed. Only one exam can
therefore be handled per repository clone.

A website with catalogue of downloadable FIPE mods is planned; currently this
repository is the only source of information.

Quickstart:
- clone repository
- enter the generator directory
- fill student accounts in the file students.in
- modify the module selection and expected scores in multigen.conf
- run all.sh
- enter the ../pdfgen directory
- have a look at the four *-out folders
- optional: proceed to the deployment folder and adjust/run scripts
