Fully Individualised Programmable Exams - FIPEs

Note: This is an early-stage prototype. It ships with very few FIPE
modules that make up the variety of tasks. A website with catalogue of
downloadable FIPE mods is planned.

Quickstart:
- run 'make install'
- create a new working directory (ideally backed up by revision control)
- run 'fipe' and follow the instructions...
- if stuck, check the 'example-demo' folder
- optional: proceed to the deployment folder and adjust/run scripts
